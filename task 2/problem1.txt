Problem 1

This program will allow the user to check the number whether it's divisible by 3 or not

     Function Main
            DECLARE REAL Dividend
            OUTPUT "Please enter the value of Dividend" 
            INPUT Dividend
     End
     Function divisibilty (REAL Dividend)
            DECLARE REAL Divisor, Reminder
            DECLARE INTEGER Quotient
            ASSIGN Quotient = DIvidend / Divisor
            ASSIGN Reminder = (Dividend / Divisor) - Quotient
            IF Reminder = 0
            PRINT RESPONSE "Given Dividend is Divisible by 3"
            THEN
            PRINT RESPONSE "Givien Dividend is not divisible by 3 

            END IF 

END
